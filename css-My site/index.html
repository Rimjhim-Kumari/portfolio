        <h3>Web-Development</h3>
        <p>I learned frontend web development way back in school days just for fun. Over time I gained wealth of experience so planned to be a full stack developer. Being a web developer is always a creative job and I design and develop experiences that make people's lives simple.</p>

        <h3>Competitive coding</h3>
        <p>I learned the fundamentals for programming, which is just what I needed as a first step for my career change. For me, competing against others, solving questions faster than them, watching yourself improve,all of it is really exciting. I have always liked solving challenging logical problems and almost all competitive programming problems require logic and the feeling of satisfaction after solving a hard problem is at another level. Learning to write programs stretches your mind and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things and I think is helpfull in all domains. In simple word we can say learning to code is learning to create and innovate.</p>
